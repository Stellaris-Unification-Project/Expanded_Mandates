For Stellaris Version: 3.2

Adds additional mandates for democratic empires. Now you're not just limited to building mining or research stations.


[h1]General Changes[/h1]
-All mandates give 10 months worth of unity
-All mandates give an additional reward that lasts for 10 years (reward depends on mandate, check your empire modifiers after a mandate is completed)
-Mandates that reward on end of term now also reward on leader death, assuming you have satisfied the mandate's requirements
-Mandates that reward on end of term instead reward when elections start
- Some mandates now have sanity checks that limit when they can show up
-Leadership of factions will occasionally change hands for various reasons
-Democracies may adopt term limits

-Restored the old awoken trait from the Limbo anomaly

[h1]Modified Mandates[/h1]
-Buildings observation posts count towards orbital research mandate
-Building a research district on a habitat will complete the orbital research mandate
-Building a mineral or energy district on a habitat will complete the orbital mining mandate
-Build District mandates now account for additional appropriate districts. Building one relevant ringworld district will complete the mandate
-Build District mandates now also count relevant buildings (such as mineral processing and rare mining buildings for mining districts)
-Industrial districts now count for the Urbanizer mandate
-Voidborn Origin gains access to all district related mandates except farming
